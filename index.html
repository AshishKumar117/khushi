  <p>Khushi, I may not be the perfect guy, but you are the perfect reason for this newfound courage. I've held these feelings close, not knowing if you feel the same, yet here I am, laying my cards on the table. In a world that may judge by appearances, know that my feelings for you go beyond what eyes can see. If you're willing to take a chance on a guy who may not have it all but has a heart full of genuine affection, then Khushi, will you be the beautiful beginning to a love story that I've been silently writing for two years?"</p>
</div>

<div class="paper image">
  <p>I don't possess the eloquence of poets or the charm of a prince, but I offer you sincerity and a love that's genuine. You see, it's not about looks or riches; it's about finding happiness in the simplicity of shared moments and shared feelings.</p>
</div>

<div class="paper image">
  <p>Khushi, in the quiet corners of my heart, a melody has been playing for two years ‚Äî a song of admiration, warmth, and a love that quietly bloomed in the silence of unspoken words.</p>
  <p>I might not be the guy with grand gestures, showering gifts and dining in fancy places, but what I can promise is a heart that beats solely for you. In the past year, we may not have shared the words of friendship, but in my heart, there has always been a space reserved just for you.</p>
